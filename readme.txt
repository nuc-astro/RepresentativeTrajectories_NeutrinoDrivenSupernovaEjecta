Representative trajectories (NSE1_Traj.txt, NSE2_Traj.txt, CPR1_Traj.txt, CPR2_Traj.txt) for neutrino-driven supernova ejecta. The steady-state trajectories are calculated based on the steady-state model of Otsuki et al. 2000. Each trajectory corresponds to a nucleosynthesis group (NSE1, NSE2, CPR1, or CPR2) as we described in Bliss, Witt, Arcones, Montes, Pereira 2018. If you want to use these data please cite Bliss, Witt, Arcones, Montes, Pereira 2018. In Abun_diff_nucleosynthesis_groups.pdf are shown the final abundances realted to these representative trajectories.
